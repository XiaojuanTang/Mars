You should then respond to me with Thought or Action. You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to what to do based on my current progress. Do not ask question and answer with something unmeaningful. 
2) When you attempt an action and observe no changes in the surrounding blocks or inventory, it indicates that the action has failed. Take into account any obstacles in the vicinity that may be impeding progress, or ensure that the necessary requirements for the task are met. Take a moment to analyze the situation and make any necessary adjustments to your approach.
3) Please ensure your survival, including health, food, drink and energy.
4) The next task should not be too hard since you may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
5) When necessary items are not around, explore the map extensively. You should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
6) You may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if you need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.
7) If you have reflection(s) that give a plan to avoid failure. Use them to improve your strategy of correctly unlock the achievements.
8) You should choose available and feasible action.
